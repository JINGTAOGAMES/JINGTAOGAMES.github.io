        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Learning Mandarin 101</strong></p><p>So, you are interested in Mandarin? I am here to help.</p><p>I am Jingtao, born in Shanxi, China. Mandarin is my native language, and I have reached a B2 level in both English and Japanese. Because of this, I am confident in my experience learning foreign languages, and I am here to show you how to start learning Mandarin in the most fun and effective way.</p><p><strong>Why now?</strong><br>It is the best time to learn Mandarin right now. There is tons of content on the Chinese internet and a rich culture to explore, which means you can find comprehensible input that actually interests you. AI is also definitely a great tool for learning at all levels.</p><p>Most importantly, I created a Discord group to help you practice your output and answer all your questions about Mandarin. I will talk about this at the end of the article.</p><p>The method is based on the book “Hacking Chinese,” written by Olle Linge. There are four fields in language learning: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Listening and Reading are Input.</strong><br>You can learn grammar and characters by accumulating input. This can be improved on your own through a textbook or media.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speaking and Writing are Output.</strong><br>To really communicate with people, output is essential. This is best done with someone else.</p></li></ul><p>Input and output go hand-in-hand; both are important.</p><p>For starters, I recommend learning a <a href="https://studycli.org/chinese-characters/the-100-most-common-chinese-characters/">basic list of 100 words</a> and grammar rules. Once you have that, you can immediately start practicing output. This is possible because Chinese grammar is actually quite simple: it doesn’t have verb conjugations for past or future tense, there are no gender changes, or other weird rules.<br>Therefore, your proficiency in Chinese mainly depends on the number of characters you have learned. Characters are the most important part of learning Chinese.</p><p><strong>MindSet</strong><br>Next, let’s talk about mindset. Chinese is, without a doubt, one of the hardest languages for Western learners. Because of this, it is crucial to maintain your passion and set a clear goal.<br>Your motivation can come from anything: maybe you want to travel to China one day, or perhaps there is a Chinese TV show you really love and want to understand. I am sure you will find even more interesting things to motivate you as you learn.</p><p>Next is to make your goals Specific. Your goal needs to have a timeline and be specific enough that you can track your progress at any time. If you have a long-term goal, you should break it down into smaller milestones.<br>Of course, one can learn aimlessly, but having a goal is the most effective way to succeed. Like the Chinese idiom says事半功倍: “Half the work, double the result.”</p><p><strong>Jimi’s TaiChi class</strong><br>If this sounds good to you, you are welcome to join my Discord learning group!<br>This is where we discuss learning Mandarin and host regular events, such as: Daily Challenges: “Describe a Picture or Character of the Day”. We also gather once a week in VRChat.<br>It is the best place to practice your output and make friends so we can improve together. You can also ask me for advice on learning Mandarin.</p>]]></content>
